    <h1>About myself</h1>
   
    <section id="about-myself">
        <p>
            I am a dedicated student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science
             in Computer Science and Chemistry at the University of the Free State.
            Having transitioned from Engineering Science, I aim to leverage my passion for technology
             and problem-solving to become a successful Data Scientist or Software Engineer, as both fields
              strongly align with my interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            My academic background includes a solid foundation in programming and problem-solving, 
            and I have developed skills in Object-Oriented Programming (C#), Python (with basics in Machine Learning),
             HTML, CSS, and data structures. Alongside my studies, I am actively
             involved in the IT Student Association and have gained hands-on experience
              as a demonstrator for introductory programming courses.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond academics, I enjoy participating in coding challenges, 
            such as Clash of Coding and Coding Wars, which help sharpen my problem-solving and technical skills.
